A GTK3 application intended for use as an open-source, calibrable [[Audiometer]].

Packaged as a Flatpak application and featuring an matplotlib based audiogram-plot and used [[LabStreamingLayer]] to emit markers.

There was also an intention to write a [[LabStreamingLayer]] capture software in GTK, but enough exist and it was too much work for the time-frame.
