[[Statistical Parametric Mapping]]
[[LORETA]]
Abstract: uses [[LORETA]], EEG, and MRI to investigate the "characteristics of the mismatch negativity generators in schizophrenia"? Need to look at MMN
Mismatch Negativity (MMN) - an ERP generated from oddball stimulus. Usually in response to change of pitch, duration, or volume
MMN obtained from subtracting ERP of standard stimulus from ERP of deviant stimulus
The resultant MMN should start 100-150msec to 200-250 msec
Supposedly MNE represents a pre-attentive stage of auditory information processing (see: Näätänen R, Gaillard AW, Mantysalo S (1978): Early selective-attention effect on evoked potential reinterpreted. Acta Psychol (Amst) 42:313–329.)
OR
"an automatic neuronal-mismatch process with a neuronal representation of the standard stimulus" (see: Mantysalo S, Näätänen R (1987): The duration of a neuronal trace of an auditory stimulus as indicated by event-related potentials. Biol Psychol 24:183–195.)
