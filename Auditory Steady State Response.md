An evoked response generated by the use of modulated tones to elicit a neural response.
The neural response is not generated through brain activity but is instead a direct physiological response to the tone, and as such the neural response is directly related to the modulation frequency of the tone presented to the subject.

Unlike ABR, this is not used commonly in [[Audiometry]]
