(1994) Low resolution electromagnetic tomography: a new method for localizing electrical activity in the brain
First paper to propose [[LORETA]]
TLDR: [[LORETA]] focuses on creating a smooth output, based on knowledge of neural responses. The smoothness of the result is the constraint.
Tests 2 datasets, 1 with 21 channels and 47 channels.

Appendix contains algorithm
