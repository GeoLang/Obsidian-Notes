A type of [[Neural Network]] [[Classifier]] that is particularly well suited to image processing.

Implementations for other applications outside of image processing exist, for example [[EEGNet]], which is a CNN designed specifically for EEG signal processing.

Implementations of [[EEGNet]] can be found in ~/Projects/gl_preprocessing/classifier_gen.py
