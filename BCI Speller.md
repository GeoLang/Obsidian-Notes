A common paradigm in BCI research where the BCI is used to input characters on a screen by focusing on the character the user wants to input.

Uses a 2D grid of characters with lines and columns blinking/flashing while the user count the number of times the number of times the row and column containing the wanted character blinks. This is functionally a [[P300]] [[Oddball]] paradigm, and the [[P300]] response can be used to identify the character the user is looking at.
