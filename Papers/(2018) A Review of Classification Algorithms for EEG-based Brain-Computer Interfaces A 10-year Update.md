#paper
A complete review of classification algorithms for [[ERP]]s over the last 10 years
Also authored a paper 10 years prior with the review until that point.

### Notes on supervised spatial filters
Authors discuss a couple of supervised spatial filters. They specifically note:
Common SPatial Patterns (CSP)
[[xDAWN]]
Fisher Spatial filters

### Paper notes some BCI studies have improved performance by combining features
There is a number of cited papers that combine multiple features (like time series and band power) to improve performance. Also combining band power and connectivity

### Discussion of [[Pearson Correlation]]
Needs more reading...

### Discusses "Wrapper" and "Embedded" feature selection
These are classifiers in their own right that select features from EEG

The authors examples are decision trees and multilayer perceptrons

### Authors note maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) and R^2 feature selection
Note - This is also as far as I read so far.
