A method of feature selection for EEG
Seems to be first proposed in [[(2009) xDAWN Algorithm to Enhance Evoked Potentials Application to Brain Computer Interface]]
An unsupervised [[P300]] feature selection algorithm, as opposed to [[Independent Component Analysis]] ICA which is supervised (meaning we must manually pick components)

MNE contains an implementation which can be found [here](https://mne.tools/stable/generated/mne.preprocessing.Xdawn.html)
