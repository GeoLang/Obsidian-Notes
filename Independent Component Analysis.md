A method of decomposing signals into their constituent elements (components).

Components must be manually selected and removed from data. There are some methods for automatic component selection (ICLabel, A pre-trained [[Neural Network]], is used by EEGLab), and components can also be automatically rejected to remove ocular artifacts *if* you also collected an Electro-Oculogram (EOG).

As an alternative, [[xDAWN]] can be used for [[P300]] and other [[ERP]] based analysis methods.
