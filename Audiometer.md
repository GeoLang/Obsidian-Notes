A calibrated tool for assessing hearing loss during an [[Audiogram]].

Plays tones at specific frequencies and volumes.
Volumes are normally in increasing octaves from 250Hz to 8000Hz
Optionally, half octaves in-between can be used, and volumes below and above can be used e.g. 125Hz and 16kHz.

We have a software implementation, [[OpenAudiogram]].

[[Audiogram]] results are presented in the above format, with intervals representing the frequencies that were presented.

The volumes are self explanatory, but the volumes correspond to the above levels of hearing loss. 

First device: "Western Electric 1A audiometer", created in 1922
