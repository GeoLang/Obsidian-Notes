A method of identifying the source of a surface neural response from EEG data

Some methods:
[[Statistical Parametric Mapping]]
[[LORETA]]

TLDR: 2 problems: A forward problem and an inverse problem
Forward problem: Given these sources, estimate the resultant scalp responses
Finite solutions
Inverse problem: Given these scalp responses, estimate the neural sources
Infinite solutions
For any scalp response, there is an infinite number of potential internal correlates.

Solutions are constraint based, with each method proposing their own constraints
Methods also require a head model: Previously spherical, now typically 3D head shaped models
